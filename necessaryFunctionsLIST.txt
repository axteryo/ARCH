=======NECESSARY STATES


----States to be Shared----
AliveSTATE
ImpactState
AttackState


The player will Have concurrent states that do not block one another.

AliveSTATE
ThrustSTATE
TurnRightSTATE
TurnLeftSTATE
AttackSTATE
ImpactSTATE



The Enemies will have Concurrent states as well as a hierarchy of states using pushdown automata

The Hierarchy Will start with the "BaseSTATE" which will be The General State of being or mood of the enemy
The next state in the heiarchy will be the "SecondaryState" which will determine the behavior of the ai,
such as attacking,chasing, and within that substate heiarchy the ai will use its "Actions" Such as an actual attack or targeting function. Concurrent states will be at the BaseState as they will influence the secondary states. Concurrent states include, IsHitState, IsAliveState,etc.

BaseSTATES:
	NEUTRAL
	OFFENSE
	DEFENSE

	SecondarySTATES:
		ATTACKING
		CHASING	
		
	AliveState
	ImpactState
	AttackState


====Sole Enemy Behavior D1


Base = OFFENSE

Secondary = Chasing

initiateCollision(EnemyAttackFixture,PlayerBody)
UseAttack(DRAIN)

secondary = attacking
AttackState = Drain


resolveCollision(EnemyAttackFixture,PlayerBody)


Secondary = chasing
AttackState = NOattack
