Collision System

Objects collide now what?

1.handle collision in the collision system via a system of nested ifs

hell fuck no

2. We split the collision handling into several specific functions within the collision system class

im listening....

We handle collisions on a case by case basis. 

Actor to Actor

Actor to Object

Actor to Sequence

Ok say we did this, would we still have nested ifs in the functions?

Thats a huge possibility, and im not sure how to go around it....
we could pass the contact object around possibly?

When doing collisions we usually assume that the objects doing the colliding are entities.
Maybe thats where we are going wrong?

say we wanted to check if player crossed a trigger

the players body fixture and the triggers trigger fixture would be the ones that collide in order to see if the trigger is activated.

so we know a body and a trigger collided, but who'se body?
