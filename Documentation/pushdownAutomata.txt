PushDown automata


BaseStateStack
and SecondaryStateStack


State Stack rules:

There will never be more than three states on any given stack.
The topMost State is the current State and each layer of states in linked to the other.

MEANING

The Base State on the stack must push a secondary state onto the stack
SO
When that base state is removed(REVERTED) OR added, the secondary state associated with it is Removed OR added
The reverse is a bit different though.

A secondary state may be added without changing the base state.
ie: Position_base, standing_secondary, Walking_secondary
