create maps
Create rooms
create characters
load level data
track level/room events


An idea is that the maps will store room data(enemies,objectives/items) the map will export the data into a room object which will spawn based on a sensor.

The level class will load and save level data

Level Data encompases: Maps, charater positions, completion information, etc.


Levels will consist of:
	A map object which will store map layer objects along with the current map texture.
	A CharacterSpawner Object which will create characters

level will load spritesheets, shapes, spawn Player, update, render, close.
	

level class:


entityList<Entity*>
roomList<room*>
	spawnPoint Struct{}
	SpawnList<spawnPoint>

load()
{
*********
	/** The tile map file is FIRST loaded and the functions below retrieve the necessary information from the JSON object **/
	
	
	
	//-getRooms()
/**for now spawn points will be their own layer instead of being encapsulated in rooms

	//-getSpawnPoints()

	//-createMap()
	

**********




	
	-SpriteBatcher.loadEntityTextures()
	//-EntitySpawner.loadEntityShapes()

/**Possible implimentation in the future:Have entity spawner take a room object and the rooms will have a list of spawn points for their local space. the level class itself will have a spawnlist for the current and last location of the player

	-EntitySpawner.Spawn(SpawnPoint)
	

	 

	//SpriteBatcher.setTextureFrame();
	gc.setFrame()
	

	
	
}

createRoom()
{
	-
