create maps
Create rooms
create characters
load level data
track level/room events


An idea is that the maps will store room data(enemies,objectives/items) the map will export the data into a room object which will spawn based on a sensor.

The level class will load and save level data

Level Data encompases: Maps, charater positions, completion information, etc.


Levels will consist of:
	A map object which will store map layer objects along with the current map texture.
	A CharacterSpawner Object which will create characters
	

level class:
load()



Helper classes:

//map
//RoomSpawner
CharacterSpawner
