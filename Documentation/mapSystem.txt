Necessary componenets of mapSystem

MapFile
MapObject
LayerObject
QuadrantSize
MapSize

The mapobject will load the map file

The map file will be split into layer objects

Each layer will be a vertex array(we have a batch object class so we can just wrap that into layers.)
---so that means that each layer will be a batch---

Each layer will be drawn in the order they are given to the level class

The map file will be composed of an array of tile data which corresponds to the tiles location on the map


Class MapObject
{
	jsValue baseMapRoot
	jsReader mapReader
	vector<int> levelData;
	vector<vector<int>> layerData; 
	batch layer1
	batch layer2
	v2f_mapDimensions
	v2f_tileDimensions
	v2f_textureSheetDimensions
	mapTexture
	
	
	loadFile()
	create()
	close()

}






The map file will be seperated into Quadrants based off of the size of it
