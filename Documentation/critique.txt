-My Assessment:

The authors comes to us with his ideas laid bare in hopes of starting a conversation,a necessary one, about the concerns of ethics in IT.
In short, i agree with the author on some ideas but i also disagree on others. I do agree that it is necessary for an IT code of ethics, given the expanding use and development of technology and software. But I do not agree that a Universal Code of ethics for IT professionals is the answer. Nor do i believe a boundary of ethics can solve problems that are likely to occur. He gave an example of a google self-driving car possibly  injuring or maiming a person and then asked to which boundaries do the ethics apply? Should the programmer be to blame, should the person on the cross walk be to blame(even if they were walking illegally.), Should the passenger be to blame or even the car manufacturer. There is just no way to encompass all probable hurdles to a single code of ethics. But that is not to say, that within each individual area of IT we cannot try to account for everything, though likely impossible it may be.
