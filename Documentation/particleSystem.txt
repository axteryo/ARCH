particle system

How would particles work?

What exactly would particles be?

particles would be an entity....

say we have a particle spawner class?

go on

the sprite batcher would parse that entity into particle spawner class(sub type say explosion or something)
it would interpret each entity differently and respond accordingly....

now how would i create a particle spawner put it in the update loop.

have some sort of observer watch and do?
for example
particleMaster.watches(player)
and pushesback(explosionParticleSpawner)into spritebatcher

Just a possible thought....
