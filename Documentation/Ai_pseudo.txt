one ai type

-Queen
The queen will control the patterns of the followers
Each Queen will have a unique ability(skills the player can obtain)
The queens general objective is to absorb the player character using her followers as a catalyst.
some queens control their followers in a different way but they all have a generic base of commands

Commands the queen can give are;

Attack
When the queen uses this command she usually chooses a few followers to chase the player around attempt to drain their power cell.

surround
This command will bring all of her followers back to be a protective shield. She usually uses this
when she either chooses to be idle or when shes going on the offensive

Shield
This skill can only be activated when she has a certain amount of followers who are in the surround mode
and they are in a certain proximity of her

Swarm
This is an all frontal attack. it usually leaves the queen wide open usually used as a last resort if you manage to damage her enough


-Followers are mindless drones that usually perform one function at a time
