What is the problem?

The sprite is showing signs of visible artifices. 

Then lerp.

Lerp doesn't work.

Why not?

Maybe it's not lerping correctly.

But we wrote it correctly.

Maybe we're not inputing correct values.

Maybe our sprite update system is all kinds of fucked

Too blanketed

Ok maybe we have been going about setting render states all wrong.

ok

Then what should we do

reassess the methods reassess the logic of it all

ok


GraphicsComponent()
{
	currentState;
	previousState;
	setCurrentState;
	setPreviousState;

}

Should there be an update? nah not really.
