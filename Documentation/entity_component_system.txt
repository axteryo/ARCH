Entity Component System

An "Entity" is an object that is interactable in the game world.

There will be different types of Entities:

Apart from their core types differentiating them
Each Entity will be characterized by the makeup of its components and the data of those components.

GameActorComponents:

Each entity will be created from the data about it in a file
Their spawn points will reside in the map file.
The map file will pass the spawn points to the entity spawner
The entity spawner will return the entities in an entity list.
