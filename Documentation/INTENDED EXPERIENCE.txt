INTENDED EXPERIENCE

In this game Movement is everything


I want the player to control a robot and to utilize the robots movement and abilities to complete Tests that are presented to you by a sarcastically Antagonistic AI. Those tests can mean anything from having to weave through corridors or having to engage enemy robots

I want the player to laugh feel excited and want to play again.
