INTENDED EXPERIENCE

the player has been sent in to defeat an ai with hive mind capabilities that is using the shell of other robots to an enact terror

In this game Movement is everything

I want the player to control a robot and to utilize the robots movement and abilities to maneuver an alien environment in order to find and defeat an Antagonistic AI, engaging enemy robots along the way.

I want the player to feel excited feel engaged, and want to play again.
