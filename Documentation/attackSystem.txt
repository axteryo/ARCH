Player presses A key
Key is mapped to useAttack1
this changes player internal state to "attacking"


Since UseAttack1 was activated, Attack1Function is used in the update function

if Attack1 is a laser, a laser will be fired in the direction the player is aiming.

How would that work?

Ideas:

A fixture in the shape of a rectangle is constantly protruding from the player(or we can create it dynamically)
/////
The player uses the attack

The UseLaserFunction creates a dynamic sensory rectangle that extends from the players body

It exerts a force on the object that overlaps in the direction the player is facing depending on the objects distance from the player



useAttack("Attack")

{
	
	if("Laser")
	{
		AttackTypeState = Laser
	}
	else("otherAttack")
	{
		AttackTypeState = OtherAttack
	}



}

Laser()
{
	createSensorHitboxFixture();
	firing = true

}
